=================

WhaleWired is a realtime, simple and powerfull tool to concatenate, index and make yoor application logs available realtime through an intuitive and powerful front-end app
The idea was coined by [Christian Landbo Frederiksen](http://twitter.com/christianlandbo ) at [Michael Ryberg Hartmann](http://twitter.com/michartmann) at Traen [traen.com] after tirelessly pounding through tons of log4j logs during our projects. 
We needed a simple solution to a complex problem - getting realtime understading of the applications logs from multiple producion servers in a intelligent way

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
