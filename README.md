=================

WhaleWired is a realtime, simple and powerfull tool to concatenate, index and make yoor application logs available realtime through an intuitive and powerful front-end app
The idea was coined by [Christian Landbo Frederiksen](http://twitter.com/christianlandbo ) at [Michael Ryberg Hartmann](http://twitter.com/michartmann) at Traen [traen.com] after tirelessly pounding through tons of log4j logs during our projects. 
We needed a simple solution to a complex problem - getting realtime understading of the applications logs from multiple producion servers in a intelligent way

Versioning
----------

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Bootstrap will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
